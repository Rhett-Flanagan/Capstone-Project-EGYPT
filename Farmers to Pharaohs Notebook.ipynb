To further such an extension livestock grazing could be implemented to help Fields recover faster through manure fertilisation.

    "### The Model Implementation\n",
    "The model implementation places all the agents on a grid and draws the river on the left side of the grid. The stopping conditions for the model are if an input time span is reached, or if all the Households have died out.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model contains several variables which will be left to the reader to examine outside of those that cause changes to model function. Fission allows Households to make a splinter Household if their population and amount of grain is large enough, which then creates a new Household within the same Settlement, and rental allows Households to rent unused Fields from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The various setup methods, excluding setupFlood, in the model are used to randomly initialise it with the constructor parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "The DataCollector is instantiated to collect data using the methods above, use lambda expressions to collect various information about the model, and use a table to collect data on the agents. Tables are the best method to collect data on the agents as agent_reporters in the Datacollector are overwritten each tick, unlike model_reporters which hold contiuous reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The step method increments the current time, uses setupFlood to update the global variables (mu, sigma, alpha and beta) used by Fields to update their fertility values. It then uses the scheduler to call step on every agent that is in the scheduler, updates the projected historical population and collects the data from that tick. It then checks if the termination methods are met."
