Mesa also provides an extensible tool to create a visualisation of a model and display graphs of data collected from said model.\n",

To further such an extension livestock grazing could be implemented to help Fields recover faster through manure fertilisation. This type of extension could be used in conjunction with machine learning principles in the Household agents to investigate if Households could learn concepts such as crop rotation, and determine the effects that such would have on the wealth growth of a household."
